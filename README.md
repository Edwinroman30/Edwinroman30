## Hi, I´m Edwin  ✌👋🏼😁

Welcome to my my GITHUB account, as you can see over there, my name is Edwin. I´m young that enjoy this world about tech, programming, math, data science and all relate to tech.

More about me... now I´m working pretty hard to become Software Engineer. The principal technology that I know or more and less I managers are: HTML, CSS, JS, a bit of Wordpress, SQL, Python and some bases about PHP, C# and Java.
